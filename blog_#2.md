# Sketchnoting, not this again
For the past few years at my study [Communication and Multimedia Design](https://www.cmd-amsterdam.nl/english/) there has been a real fandom for sketchnoting. Sketchnoting is basically visual note taking. You can find examples of the most creative and artsy note taking you ever seen.

For years I kept just making regular notes. You see, I was never a good writer or sketcher. At an age of about eight I had to take lessons because my handwriting was so poor that the teachers couldn't grade my tests. Writing and sketching take all of my concentration. So you could imagine that making those artsy sketchnotes was not going to happen for me.

At [ICONS](https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/icons-15-eva-lotta-lamm-tickets-33120075036#) Wednesday the third of may [Eva-Lotta Lamm](http://evalotta.net/) gave a talk about sketchnoting. I decided that I would either be able to write or sketch, not both. To my big surprise the sketching was not needed until the very last part of the talk. In my regular note taking I already underlined important text, wrote everything in short snippets, tried to group stuff. These things are also part of sketchnoting. The majority of the talk was about grouping, visual hierarchy and structure. No mention of sketching until the last part whatsoever. At the talk we we were told to make sketchnotes about the talk following the techniques discussed. The talk, or your sketchnotes, consisted of five major points.

* Write in chunks
* Choose the most important and make it big
* Add visual hierarchy
* Add structure
* Add visual hooks

This was something I could work with. All this time I was doing this but in a less effective way. Eva-Lotta showed us how you can utilize these techniques in sketchnoting. I learned what works for me. Since the talk I have been taking notes the way her talk was setup. By using grouping, visual hierarchy and structure I'm able to quickly write down information, enhance when there is some time and finish it up with making little sketches.

Doing it like this works for me. It still takes a lot of concentration for me to take notes this way. But my writing the information in chunks and choosing the most information and making it big I have a solid base. It's like my HTML. I know I'm fine if I've got this part covered during a talk. I can then later add visual hierarchy, structure and visual hooks. That's like my CSS.
