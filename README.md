# Weekly Nerd
Weekly nerd is a part of the minor webdevelopment at the study [Communication and Multimedia design](https://www.cmd-amsterdam.nl/english/), or CMD, at [the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences](http://www.amsterdamuas.com/). During the minor speakers from different companies, with specialisms and with different mindsets about front-end development come to give talks.

## Special thanks
Since this concludes the minor webdevelopment I would like to give a special thanks. No, this isn't to give me a good grade ;). I really appreciate all the time and energy the tutors and people who gave talks. I never felt like we were students, but more like fellow developers trying to help each other. Same goes for my fellow students. We made better developers out of ourselves and each other. I hope to work together again one day, whether it be a school project or in the field. Cheers.
