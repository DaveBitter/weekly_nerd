# Why should you follow the minor web development?
If you read the blogs in order this is the final one. I was reminiscing about this minor. What did the minor do for and to me? I learned the following things.

## Structure
During the courses [Web App from Scratch](https://github.com/DaveBitter/minor-webdev_web-app-from-scratch) I learned how to write structured code. I never really written my client-side Javascript code in an object oriented way. Well, I did and I didn't. At work we worked with frameworks like React. In these projects I would write object oriented code because I basically coded the way everybody coded in other files. I followed without knowing why. At this course I learned the why and the how. This helped me see the structure in code written by others. It also helped me understand Javascript frameworks better. They all build on this core principle.

During the course [CSS to the Rescue](https://github.com/DaveBitter/minor-webdev_css-to-the-rescue) I learned how to write structured CSS. Before this course I didn't really think about structured CSS. I know how I could make stuff look nice but didn't focus on details like focus outline styles. I learned to pay more attention to this.

## Performance
During the course [Performance Matters](https://github.com/DaveBitter/minor-webdev_performance-matters) I first got in touch with making a website perform. Previously this was always overlooked. I would make something cool and if it took some time to load, well tough luck. I learned about minifying, compressing, caching and more. Since this course I started implementing these principles in every project I work on. I'm really looking into caching data in Local Storage and background services in the form of webworkers to preload data. This is the part of webdevelopment I never looked into before the minor.

During the course [Browser Technologies](https://github.com/DaveBitter/minor-webdev_browser-technologies) I learned how to make a webapplication perform in every browser. I learned how to provide a basic experience to the oldest browsers and progressively enhance this experience the newer and more functional the browser becomes. I used these principles in every project since. This makes life much easier after the webapplication is delivered as it is easier to progressively enhance than to graceful degradate.

## Realtime
During the course [Real-Time Web](https://github.com/DaveBitter/minor-webdev_real-time-web) I learned how to make a realtime webapplication that makes use of websockets. I also learned how to implement oAuth to an application. Because of these skills I can now make webapplications that I couldn't before. This greatly influences new idea's for me. Because of websockets I can make a new range of amazing applications.

## Fun stuff
During the course [Web of Things](https://github.com/DaveBitter/minor-webdev_web-of-things) I learner how to make cool and fun things with the Internet of Things. I am not very experienced in this field so it was fun to learn more about it. I especially liked making something physical, which is a welcome change after looking at a computer screen 60 hours a week.

## Many more
I learned many more things while taking these course. I learned a whole lot about Git and GitHub that I didn't know before. Things like branching, repository management, pull requests, issues and more. I also went to my first conference [CSSday](https://cssday.nl/2017) which was really inspiring. It was cool to see how many different, but the same, kind of people were there.

## So, can I recommend the minor webdevelopment?
Yes, god yes! I thought I know a lot coming into this minor. I've grown so much as a front-end developer during the course of this minor. If you are passionate about front-end development then I can really recommend this minor. You will learn how to build amazing things in a good and structured way. I especially liked the Weekly Nerd presentations, projects for real companies at the end of each course and of course the 'Meesterproef'. During the 'Meesterproef' I got the chance with three fellow students to go to Edinburgh in Scotland for an amazing project. Opportunities that you rarely get.

## And now, after the minor webdevelopment?
I got the skillset to make amazing and robust webapplications. I'm going to implement these skills during my final internship for half a year. After that, I'm going to continue working on the project in Edinburgh as my graduation project. Cool times ahead!
