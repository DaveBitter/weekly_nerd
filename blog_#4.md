# Front-end development and Internet Of Things
During The course Web of Things at the minor webdevelopment at the study [Communication and Multimedia design](https://www.cmd-amsterdam.nl/english/), or CMD, at [the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences](http://www.amsterdamuas.com/) we discussed why we should learn this. Sure it's fun to work with, but why should this be one of the six course part of this minor?

During a talk [Niels Leenheer](https://www.nielsleenheer.nl/) told us about a one of his creations he build. I could easily replace his creation by a small webapplication. I asked him why I shouldn't just make that instead. Saves time, money and hassle. His response was that it this was cooler. It was fun and creative. I agreed, but then I started thinking. When we talk about Internet of Things we often talk about making cool creations with sensors for in example your home or in the office. Then it hit me. I've been working with the Internet of Things for over a year.

## Where does a front-end developer come in?
I work as a front-end developer at [ViriCiti](http://viriciti.com/). ViriCiti uses real-time data to improve electric vehicle operations for companies. For example, a bus company wants to gain insight in how their vehicles perform and get predictions to take educated actions on. I get data in the front-end and I work with it from there on.

One of the criticisms on the course was why we learned about making these creations. When will I use this? Well, let me tell you. Of course I don't build the computer for in the vehicles and attach sensors and all that. What I do work with is sensor data. People, much smarter than me, make useful data of the data that is received from the bus. In the front-end I have access to these data sources.

This part was part of the course. In my opinion, the part where a front-end development will shine is not the attaching sensors part, but the getting sensor data part. The sky is the limit. We have all of these data sources which on their own can provide some insight for the user, but how can you combine, sort, filter and visualize this data. This is the part of Internet of Things I like to work with. We can get all this data, but what would the user like to see. He/she doesn't care from which sensor something came or how that part works. A user wants to see a conclusion of the data.

Were I'm going with this is that Internet of Things is much bigger than making smart homes or offices. It's a data source that can be used to trigger real world reactions. Image that you can see that a bus has nearly run out of battery. You can then notify an operator that a new should take over the ride the next time the bus is at the end of the line. With this small piece of data alone, a state of charge, you can build so much useful things for different users. You can let a type of user take action based on one data source. Image what you could do as a front-end developer if you have a ton of the data sources combine, sort, filter and visualize. This is were a front-end developer can make the difference in Internet of Things.

It's an exciting time. We can get data from virtually all over the world in realtime. We can make so much useful stuff if we listen to what users would like to see and what should happen if a condition is met. The output of Internet of Things doesn't always have to be physical device with for example flashy lights and speakers. Internet of Things can be a data source to amazing webapplication that help people.
